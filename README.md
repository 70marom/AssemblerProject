# AssemblerProject
Assembler for a custom assembly language, for the university.  

For more information about the project check the Project Description file.  

Test1 - a simple example of an assembly file that passes the assembler process successfully without errors with standard output files.  
Test 2 - the example goes through the process as it should and includes a lot of components from the assembly language, the process ends successfully.  
Test 3 - an example that demonstrates a bunch of errors, all the commands have an error and the assembler warns about all the errors - line by line. No files are created as a result of running the assembler on this file.
